After my research I have determined that too much time with too many variables at play happens between these events in order to make a comprehensive prediction based on these 2 data sets alone. A lot can happen in 4 years or even 2 years such as injuries, retirements, or changes in managerial staff that gametime data just simply can not forsee. The results of this analytic process are inconclusive.
